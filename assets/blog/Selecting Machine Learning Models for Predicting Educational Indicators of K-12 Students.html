            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Predicting educational indicators of K-12 students is crucial for improving educational outcomes and guiding policy decisions. Machine Learning (ML) models can be employed to make accurate predictions based on student data. This paper aims to discuss the process of selecting the most suitable ML model for predicting educational indicators, such as academic performance and dropout rates, and the factors that influence this decision, including model accuracy, interpretability, and complexity.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The ability to predict educational indicators of K-12 students, such as academic performance, dropout rates, and resource allocation, plays a significant role in enhancing the educational experience and informing policy decisions. ML models can be utilized to make these predictions based on student data, offering valuable insights for educators, administrators, and policymakers. This paper outlines the process of selecting the most appropriate ML model for predicting educational indicators and the factors influencing this decision.</p>

            <h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing an ML Model</h2>
    
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Model Accuracy</h3>
                <p>A key factor to consider when selecting an ML model is its accuracy in predicting educational indicators. Models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks can be employed for this task, with each offering different levels of accuracy. To determine the most accurate model, cross-validation techniques can be used to assess the performance of various models on the given dataset.</p>

                <h3>Interpretability</h3>
                <p>Interpretability is essential when predicting educational indicators, as it enables stakeholders to understand the relationships between input features and the predicted outcomes. Models such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees offer higher interpretability, while more complex models like Neural Networks may be less interpretable.</p>

                <h3>Model Complexity</h3>
                <p>The complexity of an ML model can influence its performance and generalizability. Simple models may not be able to capture complex relationships within the data, leading to underfitting. On the other hand, overly complex models may overfit the data and perform poorly on unseen data. Choosing the right balance between complexity and generalization is crucial.</p>

                <h3>Computational Resources and Time</h3>
                <p>The computational resources and time required to train and deploy ML models should also be considered when selecting the most suitable model. Complex models like Neural Networks may require substantial computational power and time, while simpler models such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees typically demand less resources.</p>
