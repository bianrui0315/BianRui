            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The K-12 education system generates vast amounts of student data that can be used to make informed decisions for enhancing the educational experience. This data includes attendance records, test scores, demographic information, and individual learning styles, among others. ML and AI offer promising solutions for processing, analyzing, and predicting student data, ultimately improving teaching methodologies and identifying early intervention opportunities.</p>
